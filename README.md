# Dragon Trading Cards
_Card Website is built by using HTML and CSS._

## Project Info
Created a trading card by using HTML to create the structure for the trading card and styling it with CSS.
This project combines the skills you mastered in the problem set and asks you to re-create a webpage from a design prototype.
This is a common workflow for front-end web developers.

## Project Specification
- Design
  - The text is italicized for the animal’s interesting fact.
  - The labels are bolded for the animal’s list items.
  - The dots are removed from the animal's list items.
  - Uses border around animal’s name, image, and information (interesting fact, list items, and description).
  - Uses border around animal’s information.
  - Uses spacing between animal’s name, image, and information.
  - Card width should be fixed and include the spacing around the image (Since image is 300px wide, card should be 300px + spacing on either side. Card should not expand with the browser window).

- Custom Image and Text
  - The placeholder image and information is replaced with favorite animal image and information.
  - The image is 300px wide or the image's width is set to 300px.
  - The image’s alt is relevant to the animal used.
